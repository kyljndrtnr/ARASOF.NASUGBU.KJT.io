    <p><span style="color: #eb1c24;"><strong>Nasugbu Campus History</strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half a century ago, an educational institution was established in Nasugbu, Batangas by virtue of Republic Act 685 passed by the congress through the effort of Congressman Apolinario Reyes Apacible and the then Bureau of Fisheries Director Deogracias V.Villadolid. It was May 9, 1952, to be exact.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school which was first called the Philippine Institute of Fisheries Technology started operating in 1957 bearing the name Batangas School of Fisheries (BSF) with the two-story structure built on a three hectare-land donated by Roxas y Cia.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering Secondary Fishery Curriculum for years since then, the school has undergone remarkable changes not only in its physical facilities but also in skills and academic achievements as well.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, in 1972 a superintendent was appointed to lead the institution and was granted with the approval to offer the two and a half-year Diploma in Fishery Technology Course followed by a four-year Bachelor of Science in Fishery Education in 1975, and the Bachelor of Science in Fishery Education in 1978, all these under MECS.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then rapid and more significant developments came about. In 1981, under the Department of Education Culture and Sports, the school now called Apolinario R. Apacible School of Fisheries (ARASOF) started offering Elementary Curriculum as well as Non-Traditional Courses and other short-term courses.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 1994,by virtue ofthe Higher Modernization Act of 1994, Apolinario R. Apacible School of Fisheries was placed under the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as a supervised institution paving the way for more program offerings for the institution’s ever-growing number of clienteles. In 1996, the Bachelor of Science in Food Technology, Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management, Bachelor in Elementary Education, and Bachelor in Secondary Education programs were opened for enrollment, creating more educational opportunities for stakeholders and the local community. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under a new superintendent, ARASOF has dressed itself anew in 1997. Poised to take on the challenges of the new millennium, application for Bachelor of Science in Information Management and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology were forwarded to CHED and the approval subsequently followed.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flight of ARASOF continued through the years until that momentous day on the 25th of February Year 2000, when the wind of change swept across the campus once more, and completely altered its destiny. The Board of Trustees of the Pablo Borbon Memorial Institute of Technology approved the official Integration of ARASOF, taking the campus under its wing along with the Jose P. Laurel Polytechnique College in Malvar. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Republic Act 9045 issued on March 22, 2001, created The Batangas State University by integrating the Pablo Borbon Memorial Institute of Technology with its branches, Jose P. Laurel Polytechnique College in Malvar and Apolinario R. Apacible School of Fisheries. ARASOF became one of the eleven campuses that completed the Batangas State University System. </span></p>
    <p>Known in the region now as the Batangas State University, The National Engineering University ARASOF-Nasugbu Campus, the institution caters to 7,310 students as of 1<sup>st</sup> Semester of AY 2022-2023 as it continues to strive towards maintaining academic excellence and alignment to the University system’s vision. Distinguishing itself through quality multidisciplinary course offerings, the campus now boasts of six colleges and a laboratory school.</p>
